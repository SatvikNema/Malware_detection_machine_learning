## Classification of Executable as Malware or not using Supervised Machine Learning

In cybersecurity, there is now growing interest in applying machine learning to malware classification as evidenced by several publications from academia as well as industry.
What we will be doing - We will use a dataset which is made with the help of the “pefile” package in python. “pefile” is a multi-platform Python module to parse and work with Portable Executable (aka PE) files. Most of the information contained in the PE headers is accessible as well as all sections' details and their data.

These headers (and sections) actually convey a lot of information about the file, which makes it an important factor in classifying malicious files. On various files (pe executable formats), this package is used and considerable data is generated for both the malicious files and legitimate files.

Now that we know how the dataset is, different models will be made, which will be based on 3 machine learning algorithms (namely – K-nearest neighbours, XGBoost and Random Forest). In Machine Learning, classification is the problem of assigning an input sample into one of the target categories. For malware detection, the two categories which we already know are legitimate and malicious files. Training data consists of data samples with ground truth labels (stating whether they are legitimate or malicious). After the training is done, we test our model with the “testing data”, which had been created initially (separate from the training data).

The algorithms which will be used are actually different types of classifying algorithms, each one having its own pros and cons. Now, for this particular use case (malware classification), the results are compared to see which of these algorithms is the most optimal in classifying whether the given set of file attributes belongs to a malicious file or a legitimate file.
